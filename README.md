# HWSF

Welcome to the HWSF Coding Club - Face Detection repository!

This is a collaborative project for students from Harris Westminster Sixth Form.
We will try to implement a face detection algorithm, following the instruction of the Viola Jones paper 
Rabid Object Detection Using a Boosted Cascade of Simple Features. (See pdf)
